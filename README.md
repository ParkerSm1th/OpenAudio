## Help OpenAudioMc!
OpenAudioMc is a free spigot plugin and we'd like to keep it this way.  But to keep OpenAudioMc up and running, we need to host multiple servers (SocketIO, Web servers and more...) and this is expensive. This is why I've made a [donation page](http://donate.craftmend.com/), everything goes to the hosting for OpenAudioMc.
